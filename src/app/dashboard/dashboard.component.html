    This is a hobby project of mine focused on exploring ideas related to:
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a platform for on-going small, personal project development</li>
      <li>Bringing closure to unresolved interests in playing with spotify's track audio_features</li>
      <li>Personal Experiments With CI/CD</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
   <i> Use of this application's primary feature, a playlist management tool, requires additional external authentication through spotify.</i>

  <div class="row">
    <button class="spotify-login col-3" mat-raised-button (click)="spotifyLogin()" [disabled]="loggingIn">
      <span *ngIf="!loggingIn">
        <img src="./../../assets/Spotify_Icon_CMYK_White.png" alt="" />
        <span><p>Login with Spotify</p></span>
